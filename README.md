## Misc

- This work only uses React hooks and **no** full React.Components.
- It was set up with the tool create-react-app. The tool creates a Node.js Server and all dependencies are defined in the package.json file.
- The index.js file is the start point for the React application which injects the 'RootComponent.js' in the index.html.
- You can auto-format the source code with the command `npx prettier --write .` in the root directory (. is the directory where you want to apply auto-formatting). 
Associated files are .prettierignore and .prettierrc.json.
- At the time of development, there was only a beta version of bootstrap 5 available. Make sure to use a proper release version once it is released.
